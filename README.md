### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Eric and I am a freelance full-stack software developer based out of Montreal, Canada.

I have been working primarily with Laminas MVC for backend servers, React for frontend and React Native for mobile apps.

I am one of the maintainers for the [LM-Commons](https://github.com/LM-Commons) series of Laminas companion packages on GitHub.

I write on [Medium](https://medium.com/@eric.richer) every once in a while.

ðŸ‘¯ I am opened for opportunities in software development.
